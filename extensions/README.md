#  Microsoft Edge Extensions

Extensions are small programs that can be used to add new features to Microsoft Edge or modify the existing functionality. Extensions are intended to improve a user’s day-to-day browsing experience by providing niche functionality that is important to targeted audiences.

Microsoft Edge will soon support a new HTML, JavaScript and CSS based extension model in a future update. This new model is Chrome-compatible which means that existing Chrome extension developers will be able to migrate their extensions to Microsoft Edge with minimal changes.

We’re currently building and validating our extension platform and documentation with the help of a small number of extension authors. Please stay tuned for future updates!
