## New to Performance? [Start with F12.](../f12-devtools-guide)

## Looking to dig deep? [Try the Windows Performance Toolkit.](windows-performance-toolkit)
The Microsoft Edge team uses the Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) for analyzing browser performance. WPT was created by the Windows team to conduct in-depth program performance analysis. It straddles the boundaries between website JavaScript and Microsoft Edge native code, allowing both to be viewed within the same tool. WPT can be used to:
 - Measure CPU time taken for software to complete work
 - Calculate the memory allocated by software
 - Show the details of downloading files from remote servers
 - Measure frame rate.
 Here's how to [investigate website performance using the Windows Performance Toolkit](windows-performance-toolkit).
