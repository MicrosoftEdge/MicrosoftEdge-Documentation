# Contributing to Microsoft Edge documentation

There are several ways you can contribute to the docs on dev.modern.IE:

## Adding new docs
New contributions are welcome! Currently the GitHub directory structure parallels the table of contents on the site, but the docs are in early stages and things might get reorganized in the future.

## Updating documentation
The F12 tools guide is currently the only content set in this repo, but it is open for contributions! (All other content is still being ported from [MSDN Library](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn997183.aspx)).

## Reporting bugs in the docs
Please [open an issue](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MicrosoftEdge-Documentation/issues) if you come across outdated or inaccurate information in docs. You can use the [Feedback & Support](http://dev.modern.ie/community/support/) page for all other questions and issues about Microsoft Edge and the F12 dev tools.

# Using Pull Requests
If you want to contribute to the repo, please use a GitHub pull request. There are just a couple things to keep in mind:
- Make sure there is an issue open for your PR. If there isn't, please file a new one.
- The commit message should reference the issue and hopefully fix it (you can use "fixes #issueNumber" or "ref #issueNumber" if it doesn't fix it completely).

Thank you for contributing to the Microsoft Edge docs!
