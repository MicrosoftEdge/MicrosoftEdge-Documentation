# Real-time communication features

## Message channels

[Message channels](./message-channels) enable two-way communication between browsing contexts by allowing code from two different source domains to communicate directly via ports in a way designed to avoid cross-site scripting attacks.

## Object Real-Time Communications API (ORTC)

The [Object Real-Time Communications API (ORTC)](./object-RTC-API) enables media (audio and/or video) to be streamed (sent and received) in real-time directly between web browsers, mobile devices, and servers via native Javascript APIs. Learn more about how ORTC works, steps being taken toward WebRTC compatibility, and get hands-on by trying a demo.
