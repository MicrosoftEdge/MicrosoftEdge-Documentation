# High DPI support

Microsoft Edge brings enhanced scaling for high DPI screens and small slates, ensuring the consistency of your websiteâ€™s text, touch targets, and layout across Windows 10 devices.

Microsoft Edge supports the  [`devicePixelRatio`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn255104) property, which represents the ratio between physical device pixels and DPI-adjusted logical CSS pixels. This property has become the standard for device resolution across the web due to its simplicity.

## Improved scale factor selection

Microsoft Edge has logic for determining the most optimal scale factor, incorporating viewing distance considerations, a wider selection of default scale factors, and a number of other variables.

Zoom level settings range from 100% all the way up to 1000%, going up by increments of 25%.
Windows 10 consumers and OEMs  (Original Equipment Manufacturers) get more flexibility for consistently optimal viewing of your website across device form factors and screen resolutions.

| Zoom level settings  | 100% | 125% | 150% | 175% | 200% | 250% | 300% | 400% | ...1000% |

## Unified optical zooming model

With Microsoft Edge all zooming is now handled with optical zoom, making the experience across zooming scenarios (such as the [Zoom menu](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=614840), [Pinch zoom](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/Dn742468#inter_touch_image5), [Keyboard / mouse shortcuts](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=619896), [`@-ms-viewport`](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/Hh869615), and [`msContentZoomFactor`](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ie/hh772066)) much simpler and more predictable.
