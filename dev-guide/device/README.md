## Device orientation and motion events
[Device orientation and motion events](./device-orientation-and-motion-events) provide event info about the physical orientation and motion of your user's device, allowing you to take advantage of modern sensors and explore new input mechanisms and gestures for games and apps.

## Fullscreen API
You can use the [Fullscreen API](./fullscreen-API) to bring video, images, and other content to a user's full attention.

## Geolocation
The [Geolocation API](./Geolocation) is a built-in location provider that uses Wi-Fi location data and Internet Protocol (IP) address information to determine the latitude and longitude of the computer or device running the browser.
