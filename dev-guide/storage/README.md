# Storage features

## Indexed Database(IndexedDB)
[IndexedDB](./IndexedDB) enables you to store structured data. Unlike cookies and DOM Storage, IndexedDB provides features that enable you to group, iterate, search, and filter JavaScript objects.

## Web Storage
[Web Storage](./web-and-offline-storage) includes two related mechanisms for persisting client-side data in a secure manner using the Document Object Model (DOM), sessionStorage and localStorage. Web Storage is often compared to HTTP cookies. Like cookies, Web developers can store per-session or domain-specific data as name/value pairs on the client using Web Storage. However, unlike cookies, Web Storage makes it easier to control how information stored by one window is visible to another.
