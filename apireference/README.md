# The Microsoft Edge API Surface

Microsoft Edge provides support for over 4300 standards-based open web APIs.
Additionally, Microsoft Edge is part of the larger Universal Windows
Platform (UWP) that powers [Windows apps using JavaScript and HTML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/mt280216.aspx) and
also the [HTML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/dn301831.aspx) and  [XAML](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview)
versions of the UWP WebView control. The Microsoft Edge API surface thus also includes
specific features for building Windows apps.

Here you'll find an index of the APIs currently supported in Microsoft Edge, as well
as new APIs only available in the latest [Windows Insider](https://insider.windows.com/) preview
builds. Supported interfaces are described using the *Web Interface Definition Language*, [Web IDL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_IDL).
